This folder holds a general setup for vue.js with the vue router vuex and axios.
Ready to deploy a dashboard that will interpretate data received by a questionnaire.

There is yet no signup or login pages and the code to do that

### General Structure
```
The main page currently in the location.vue that holds all the code.
This allows to show pie charts and tables of the data received from the questionnaire.
Here currently the page is seeking data from a php file.
php files exist, but haven't been uploaded to the different projects
